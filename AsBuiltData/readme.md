# Fg Falcon As Built Data Index  

`For anyone wanting to upload their as built data files - note that your Vehicle Indentification Number is in the data and can be pulled out very easily. The Bluetooth Phone Module and Audio Interface Module contain only one thing - the VIN number, so they are not really necessary to share. All the others have the VIN and other settings contained within. The ABS module data is necessary for turbo conversions, same goes for those dropping a 5.4 into an XR6`

`Please also note that BEM As builtdata includes keyfob data. 
Your key can be cloned using this data and your car can be started(without your keys)!
If you have shared your BEM as built data online, please use the remote key teaching procedure to erase your existing keys and re-learn key.
Refer to workshop manual below /Remote key teaching:`
