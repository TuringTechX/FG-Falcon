Electronic Throttle

ETC Switch: Master enable/disable for the Electronic Throttle Control (ETC) system.
ETC Throttle Angle Gain - Derivative:
ETC Throttle Angle Gain - Integral:
ETC Throttle Angle Gain - Proportional:
ETC Throttle Angle Max:
ETC Throttle Angle Min:
ETC Demand Torque: Allows the manual selection of demand torque table.
ETC Driver Demand Wheel vs. Output RPM vs. Pedal Position: Current demanded torque from driver based on output RPM.
ETC Driver Demand Engine vs. Engine RPM vs. Pedal Position: Current demanded torque from driver based on engine RPM.
ETC Predicted Throttle Angle vs. Baro vs. VAC: Predicted throttle position used for error checking.
ETC Effective Area vs. Throttle Angle vs. Vacuum: The effective area of the throttle body based on throttle angle and vacuum. This is used to calculate the airflow thru the TB.
ETC Max Throttle Angle vs. RPM: The maximum allowed throttle angle in relation to RPM.

Pedal

ETC Pedal Follower: Master enable/disable for the Pedal follower system.
ETC Throttle Angle vs. Pedal Position: This table defines the desired throttle angle in relation to pedal position when in pedal follower mode.
ETC Pedal Angle vs. Pedal Position: This defines the pedal angle in relation to the raw measured pedal position.
APP Sensor 1 Mult: This is the pedal position sensor #1 multiplier.
APP WOT Enable: If the APP counts are above this then you are at WOT.
APP WOT Disable: If the APP counts are below this then you are not at WOT.
APP Part Throttle Enable: If the APP counts are above this then you are at Part Throttle.
APP Part Throttle Disable: If the APP counts are below this then you are not at Part Throttle.
ETC Pedal Position WOT Start: Defines the range that the ECM detects wide open throttle.
ETC Pedal Position WOT End: Defines the range that the ECM detects wide open throttle.

Misc

ETC Error Checking: Master enable/disable for all ETC error checking.
ETC IPC ROM Switch:
ETC IPC ROM Enable:
ETC Pressure/Density Scale: Master enable/disable for pressure/density scaling of ETC parameters such as demand torque.
ETC TPS Airflow: If enabled the PCM will use additional throttle based airflow calculations.
ETC Steady State Throttle Angle Error Max: This is used to determine when the throttle angle is changing faster than commanded.
ETC Wheel Torque Error Max: The maximum number of torque errors you can accumulate before generating an error.
